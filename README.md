# Recommendation platform
The objective of this project is to improve the production of the company and to facilitate the flow of information through workflows.
Thatâ€™s why we proposed a knowledge base, which is a web application jee based on ontologies and SPARQL queries (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) allowing the user to avoid wasting precious time by the customer service teams and provide a satisfactory response to customers. Also, the user will be able to have his own information and offer an effective solution to resolve breakdowns occurring during work. Finally the results of this project are shown.
